                        <h2>Easy, Frugal, and Gluten Free Spaghetti and Meat Sauce</h2>
                        <p>Who doesn’t love a giant bowl of noodles? My mom is a spaghetti fanatic, and I think I inherited the spaghetti gene. Being gluten free, doesn’t stop me from eating my favorite foods and it certainly doesn’t stop me from eating spaghetti! </p>
                        <p>It’s important to me to be able to know what is in my foods, while also keeping costs down. Often, I find that organic jars of marinara can be upwards of $5 or $6 dollars! This is ridiculous to me. You can make your own at home, just as easily, at a fraction of the cost. In my opinion, making at home makes it taste even better!</p>
                        <p>There are plenty of ways to customize and make this recipe your own. Change out the herbs for your favorites, add a variety of vegetables, switch the beef for ground turkey or seitan. One of my favorite ways to make homemade marinara is to use fresh tomatoes from the farmers market and let it simmer all day….but ain’t nobody got time for that! This recipe uses canned tomatoes, but please, if you have the time, use 7-8 medium sized tomatoes, diced into small pieces, and simmer on low for a few hours with fresh herbs and onions. Your taste buds will thank you! </p>
                        <p>Remember, cooking recipes are guidelines. If one of these ingredients does not work for you or your family, swap it out for something else, or leave it out all together! You are not made to serve the recipe, but the recipe serve you! </p>

                            <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes (the same amount of canned diced (drained) will do in a pinch!)</li>

                            <li>2 TBS of diced garlic (from the jar or fresh)</li>
